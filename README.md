## Important Warning

**Data Loss:** This script will **erase all data** on your device, including the existing operating system (unless downgrading to iOS 10.3.3 or later). **Back up your device completely before proceeding.** Data lost during this process cannot be recovered.

**Risk:** Use this script at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of data resulting from its use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **macOS:** Catalina (10.15) or later.
*   **Python:** 3.6 or later.
*   **Hardware:** An Intel-based Mac (AMD CPUs/Hackintoshes are not supported).
*   **Internet:**  A stable internet connection.
*   **Storage:** At least 20 GB of free disk space.
*   **USB:** A USB Type-A port and a Lightning cable (USB Type-C ports and dongles can be unreliable)
*   **Working iDevice:** The device must be functional enough to allow the script to back up critical files, including `apticket.der`, `sep-firmware.img4`, `Baseband`, and `keybags`.

### Installation

1.  **Install Git (if needed):** Open Terminal and run `xcode-select install`.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** In Terminal, run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kaiden-AC/Semaphorin.git && cd Semaphorin
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Enter DFU Mode:** Connect your device to your Mac and put it into DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode. (See online tutorials for specific device instructions if needed).

2. **Initial Restore:** Run the downgrade script using the following command in Terminal:
    ```bash
    sudo ./semaphorin.sh <target_ios_version> --restore
    ```
    Replace `<target_ios_version>` with the iOS version you wish to downgrade to (e.g., `sudo ./semaphorin.sh 9.3 --restore`).

3.  **Current iOS Version Input:** The script will prompt you for your **current** iOS version. Type in the correct version and press Enter to continue.

4.  **Follow On-Screen Instructions:** The script will guide you through the downgrade process, including rebooting multiple times. This process may take a considerable amount of time.

5. **Post-downgrade Jailbreak:**
    *   **iOS 9 or later:** Look for the jailbreak application on your home screen.
    *   **iOS 8 or below:** Device will already be jailbroken.

### Subsequent Boots

After the initial downgrade, you can boot into the downgraded iOS version using:

```bash
sudo ./semaphorin.sh <downgraded_ios_version> --boot
```
    
  Replace `<downgraded_ios_version>` with the version you have already downgraded to (e.g., `sudo ./semaphorin.sh 9.3 --boot`).

## Troubleshooting

### Deep Sleep Issues
Your device may experience "deep sleep" issues after downgrading, causing it to not wake up when locking it. 
* **Workaround:** Install the tweak "Fiona" from Julioverne's repo. This tweak may have a small effect on your battery life.
 * Repo URL: `julioverne.github.io`

### WiFi Issues

Issues connecting to Wi-Fi networks (e.g., incorrect password errors) can occur after downgrading. Use an **open Wi-Fi** network to bypass this problem. You can create a temporary open network from your macOS machine using Internet Sharing or on Linux using `linux-wifi-hotspot`. Take care to secure your network if you use this method.

### Safari not working (iOS 10)
Use the **FileManager** app on the home screen as a temporary replacement. It has a built-in download manager.

### Safari and other apps broken (iOS 7)
1. Reboot your device.
2. Open the Terminal app.
3. Enter `su -` and press Enter.
4. Enter `alpine` as the password and hit Enter.
5. Enter `reload` and hit Enter. This will patch sandbox and load all your tweaks. You may have to do this twice to respring your device.
